## 1. Game Selection & Scope (Sprint 0)


### 1.1 Game Overview
- **Chosen Game:**  Connect Four
- **Player Capacity:** 2 Players (Simulated via 2 CML Client nodes)
- **Game Summary:** Connect Four is a popular token based 2-player tabletop game classically played using a 
          vertical grid of 7 slotted columns that tokens are placed in from the top and slide down through a 
          maximum of 6 rows. A player wins the game when 4 of their placed tokens are uninteruppted in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line.

### 1.2 Core Game Rules & Win/Draw Conditions
- **Turn Mechanics:** Two tokens, of colors red and yellow, are used during the game. Player 1 will make the first move with 
          a red token by dropping it in any of the 7 vertical columns. Player two will then drop their token wherever they would like aswell.
          Continuing until a draw or victory for either player.
- **Victory Condition:** Victory is acheived by either player when 4 of their placed tokens are in an uninteruppted line horizontally, diagonally, or vertically on the board.
- **Draw/Tie Condition:** A draw or tie is only when there are no more available slots on the playing board for either player to place a token.

## 2. Application-Layer Messaging Protocol Blueprint (Sprint 1 Deliverable)

### 2.1 Message Transport & Serialization Format
- **Transport Protocol:** TCP
- **Serialization Format:** [JSON / Fixed-Header Binary / Delimited Text]
- **Framing Mechanism:** [e.g., Newline-delimited (`\n`) JSON payloads OR 4-byte big-endian length prefix]

### 2.2 Message Schema Definitions

#### Message Types:
1. `CONNECT` (Client -> Server): Request to join the game room.
2. `LOBBY_WAIT` (Server -> Client): Notification that server is waiting for Player 2.
3. `GAME_START` (Server -> Clients): Game initiated, assigns roles (e.g. Player X vs Player O).
4. `MOVE` (Client -> Server): Player action (e.g., cell coordinates or answer choice).
5. `STATE_UPDATE` (Server -> Clients): Broadcast current game board / state and active player turn.
6. `GAME_OVER` (Server -> Clients): Victory / Draw notification with final scores.
7. `ERROR` (Server -> Client): Invalid move or malformed packet error.

#### Example JSON Protocol Schema:
```json
{
  "msg_type": "MOVE",
  "player_id": "Player_1",
  "payload": {
    "row": 0,
    "col": 2
  },
  "timestamp": 1727000000
}
```

### 2.3 Game State Machine (FSM) Design (Sprint 1 Deliverable)
- **State Transitions:** Detail state flow: `INIT` -> `WAITING_FOR_PLAYERS` -> `PLAYER_TURN` -> `EVALUATE_MOVE` -> `CHECK_WIN_DRAW` -> `GAME_OVER` -> `CLEANUP`.

---

## 3. Game Behavior & Server Concurrency Architecture (Sprint 2 Deliverable)

### 3.1 Server Concurrency Strategy
- **Architecture Choice:** [Multi-Threading (`threading.Thread`) OR Non-blocking I/O multiplexing (`select.select` / `selectors`)]
- **Synchronization Logic:** Explain how shared game state and client list are thread-safe (e.g. `threading.Lock`) to prevent race conditions during turn processing.

### 3.2 State & Score Synchronization Across Clients
- **Turn Enforcement:** Detail how the server validates active player ID before processing moves and broadcasts updated turn notifications to all clients.
- **Score & Board Synchronization:** Describe how state broadcasts keep client screens synchronized in real time.

---

## 4. Coding & AI Implementation Plan (Sprint 3)

- **Permitted AI Tools:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude]
- **AI Prompting & Constraint Strategy:** Explain how you will constrain AI models to generate code (in Python or your chosen language) that adheres strictly to the protocol blueprint and FSM designed in Sprints 1 & 2.
- **Implementation Risk Management:** Detail your plan to leverage past programming experience and manage time to ensure code completion on schedule.

## 5. CML Multi-Subnet Topology & Wireshark Deployment Plan (Sprint 4 & 5 Deliverable)

> For now you can use the topology below. We may update this when we get to defining subnets.

### 5.1 Subnet & Router Design
- **Subnet A (Client 1):** `192.168.10.0/24` (Interface `Gi0/1` on Router R1)
- **Subnet B (Client 2):** `192.168.11.0/24` (Interface `Gi0/2` on Router R1)
- **Subnet C (Game Server):** `192.168.20.0/24` (Interface `Gi0/1` on Router R2)
- **Router Backbone:** `10.0.0.0/30` (Interface `Gi0/0` on R1 <-> `Gi0/0` on R2)

### 5.2 DHCP Pools & DNS Configuration Plan
- **Router R1 DHCP Pool 1 (`CLIENT1_POOL`):** Leases `192.168.10.10` - `192.168.10.50`, gateway `192.168.10.1`, DNS `10.0.0.2`.
- **Router R1 DHCP Pool 2 (`CLIENT2_POOL`):** Leases `192.168.11.10` - `192.168.11.50`, gateway `192.168.11.1`, DNS `10.0.0.2`.
- **Router R2 Authoritative DNS:** Configured with `ip dns server` and static host mapping `server.[yourlastname].edu` -> `192.168.20.100`.

### 5.3 Deployment Strategy & Wireshark Trace Capture
- **CML Deployment Strategy:** Deploy `server.py` onto Subnet C node (`192.168.20.100`) behind Router R2, and `client.py` onto Subnet A and Subnet B nodes behind Router R1.
- **Cisco Infrastructure Configuration:** Router R1 DHCP pools (`CLIENT1_POOL`, `CLIENT2_POOL`) and Router R2 authoritative DNS (`ip host server.[lastname].edu 192.168.20.100`).
- **Wireshark Trace Capture Plan:** Capture DHCP DORA exchange (`dhcp_negotiation.pcap`) and DNS query/response resolution (`dns_lookup.pcap`).
